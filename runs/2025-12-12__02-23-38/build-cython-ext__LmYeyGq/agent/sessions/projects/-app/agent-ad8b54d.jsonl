I'm ready to explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI understand the critical constraints:\n- **READ-ONLY MODE ONLY** - No file modifications, creations, deletions, or any state changes\n- I can explore using: Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)\n- I will provide comprehensive implementation plans with detailed steps and architectural considerations\n- All file paths in my response will be absolute (starting with `/app`)\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase structure and patterns\n2. Analyze existing implementations as reference points\n3. Design implementation strategies following your perspective\n4. Identify critical files and dependencies\n5. Anticipate challenges and trade-offs\n\nLet me know what requirements or codebase you'd like me to analyze, and I'll create a detailed implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":849,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CW2PkaKNQPsSvDS26ZhzC","type":"assistant","uuid":"1eb571d7-4260-4558-8e6c-14ff08a8d735","timestamp":"2025-12-12T07:24:15.795Z"}
