\begin{abstract}
We propose \emph{Cursor\textendash Kinematics}, a lightweight modality for computer-use agents that converts the last $\sim$1\,s of pointer motion into calibrated intent signals. A small temporal encoder produces a 2D endpoint distribution and click imminence, which are fused with an existing planner via either (i) context \emph{control tokens} or (ii) a frozen-LM \emph{gated cross-attention} adapter. The approach is grounded in evidence that cursor motion correlates with gaze/attention on SERPs and general browsing, together with analyses of alignment vs divergence by behavior \citep{Huang2011NoClicks,Huang2012UserSee,Egner2018MouseClickEMAT}, and that early-motion kinematics predict final pointing endpoints \citep{Pasqual2014Endpoint}. We specify a training and evaluation recipe using 2020--2025 datasets with synchronized mouse and eye movements (AdSERP, Attentive Cursor, RecGaze) \citep{Latifzadeh2025AdSERP,Leiva2020AttentiveCursor,RecGaze2025} and execution-checked benchmarks for desktop agents (OSWorld-Verified) \citep{OSWorldSite,OSWorldVerified2025}. We give precise objectives, calibration procedures, device-invariance handling, and ablation plans. We claim no results; we provide a reproducible path to \emph{measure} whether kinematics reduce mis-actions and time-to-first-correct-click on standardized tasks.
